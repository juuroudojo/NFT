# NFT COLLECTION 
The PowerPuffV2 Collection inhereting the ERC1155 protocol allows user to mint a random NFT. Randomisation is realized through VRFCoordinator by ChainLink.

In order for the random feature to work a sufficient balance of LINK tokens needs to be maintained by the deployer wallet at all times.
